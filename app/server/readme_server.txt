This is how you run a local server:

Requirements for running server
- Node.js

Required npm packages
- bcrypt
- bodyParser
- express
- mongoose
- morgan
- nodemon

Recommended for testing api
- Postman

1. Go to directory: platform-spanning-systems/app/server in your command window.
2. To run server write: "nodemon server.js". Successful if "Server is running on port:8000" is displayed.
3. Open a new web page on your computer and write: "localhost:8000/[collection]", for example: "localhost:8000/users".
4. If you want to try the API you can use postman. The API specifies what methods(post, get, delete e.g.) that can be used with each route.
